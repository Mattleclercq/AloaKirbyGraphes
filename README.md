INFO : The downloadExcel.py will download the excel file and store it inside ServerExposeGraphes/public/ and then all the scripts will take this as input and put the resulted graph in the same folder

You need those libraries : <br />
`pip3 install matplotlib`<br />
`pip3 install numpy`<br />
`pip3 install pandas`<br />

Then simply run:<br />
